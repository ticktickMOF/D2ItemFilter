/************************************************************
*	D2Constants.h											*
*															*
*	This file is meant to declare various					*
*	constant data. As you add more and more					*
*	custom code, you will be using many						*
*	constant values used by the game. the					*
*	unit type is a good example. declaring					*
*	constants also allows you to assign a name				*
*	to a number (which is usually more convenient)			*
*															*
*	Another advantage is, if this constant value			*
*	ever has to change for whatever reason you might		*
*	have to change it, you only have one file to change		*
*	rather than every single files using the said constant	*
